**NOTE**: _This is work-in-progress and represents a prototype, not a full solution!_

IFSBench is a prototype tool that aims to provide Python-based
testing and performance benchmarking capabilities for IFS development
workflows. It is based on Python wrapper classes and tools to create
a set of lightweight benchmark scripts that provide additional features
and a more "pythonic" flavour of tooling. The primary planned features are:

* Configurable per-test benchmark scripts with an improved CLI
  (command-line interface).
* Reference benchmark results are processed as pandas.DataFrame
  objects and can be stored (and thus version-controlled) in a variety
  of light-weight formats (eg, .csv) without the need for complete log
  files.
* Large benchmark setups (eg. tl159-fc or tco399-fc) that can symlink,
  copy or download necessary input data from pre-defined locations and
  thus do not need git(-lfs) or cmake-based symlinking at configure
  time.
* Ability to parse DrHook profiles (thanks to Iain Miller!) into
  commonly accessible formats (again based on pandas.DataFrames), as
  well as the traditional test-based output format.
